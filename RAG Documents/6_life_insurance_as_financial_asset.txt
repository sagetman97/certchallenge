Life Insurance as a Financial Asset
===================================

Life insurance is often viewed solely as a way to provide a death benefit, but certain policies can also function as financial assets during the policyholder’s lifetime.

- **Asset‑building policies:** Some life insurance policies – namely whole life and universal life – build cash value.  Like an IRA or mutual fund, these policies allow the owner to accumulate assets that can be accessed while alivehttps://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/investing/investment-strategy/how-to-use-life-insurance-as-a-financial-asset#:~:text=Key%20takeaways.
- **Access to cash value:** Depending on the plan, policyholders may be able to take a loan from the policy, use it as collateral, withdraw funds, receive accelerated benefits or cash out the policyhttps://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/investing/investment-strategy/how-to-use-life-insurance-as-a-financial-asset#:~:text=,or%20cash%20out%20the%20policy.  If structured properly, accessing cash value may avoid immediate tax liabilityhttps://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/investing/investment-strategy/how-to-use-life-insurance-as-a-financial-asset#:~:text=About%20half%20of%20Americans%20were,19.
- **Permanent vs. term:** Only permanent insurance policies that accumulate cash value – typically whole life and universal life – can serve as an asset.  Term policies are generally cheaper but do not build cash valuehttps://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/investing/investment-strategy/how-to-use-life-insurance-as-a-financial-asset#:~:text=Of%20course%2C%20not%20all%20life,that%20you%20can%20tap%20into.

**Whole life policies**

- Part of each premium goes into a cash‑value account that grows at a minimum guaranteed rate.  Premiums usually remain level for the life of the policyhttps://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/investing/investment-strategy/how-to-use-life-insurance-as-a-financial-asset#:~:text=Whole%20life%20insurance,typically%20won%E2%80%99t%20increase%20over%20the.  This savings component can be borrowed against or withdrawn, subject to policy terms.

**Universal life policies**

- Universal life policies allow the policyholder to grow an asset by accruing interest over time and offer flexibility in premium payments.  However, premiums are not fixed and the rate of return is not guaranteed.  A variant called *variable universal life* enables the policyholder to invest earnings in mutual funds, offering the potential for higher returnshttps://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/investing/investment-strategy/how-to-use-life-insurance-as-a-financial-asset#:~:text=Universal%20life%20Insurance,24.

**Cautions**

- Not every policy is designed to function as an investment.  Policy owners should read the fine print and consult an advisor to understand how and when they can access cash value and any tax implicationshttps://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/investing/investment-strategy/how-to-use-life-insurance-as-a-financial-asset#:~:text=,or%20cash%20out%20the%20policy.

By choosing the right permanent life insurance policy, individuals can build a tax‑advantaged asset that complements traditional investments and provides flexibility during their lifetime.
