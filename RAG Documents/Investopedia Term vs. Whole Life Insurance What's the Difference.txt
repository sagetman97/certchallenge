Term vs. Whole Life Insurance: What's the Difference?
By Pat Howard Updated February 27, 2025
Fact checked by Vikki Velasquez
Term life and whole life are two of the most common types of life insurance policies—providing a tax-free payout to your loved ones if you die. Term life insurance is simpler and cheaper, and may be suitable if you mainly need income replacement for a specific time, like while you’re raising kids. Whole life insurance provides lifelong coverage and can act like a tax-advantaged retirement savings plan with a guaranteed rate of return. Here’s how to understand the pros, cons, and best uses of each.

Key Takeaways
Term life insurance provides coverage for a predetermined period (the term) and is more affordable than whole life insurance. It does not accumulate cash value, meaning you can’t withdraw or borrow against the policy while you’re alive.
Whole life insurance offers lifelong coverage so long as you continue paying your premiums and includes an investment component that grows over time. However, whole life policies are significantly more expensive than term life insurance.
Term life is ideal if you only need coverage for a finite period, such as while raising children or paying off a mortgage.
Whole life is better for those who want coverage for life as well as the ability to build retirement wealth and income through the policy’s cash value account.
Some term life policies offer a conversion option that allows you to switch it to a whole life policy in the future. If you think you might want lifelong coverage eventually, but prefer a lower-cost term life policy for right now, look for a convertible term policy.

Term Life Insurance: Affordable Coverage for a Limited Time
Term life insurance covers you for a set period, like 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Some insurers may offer terms of up to 40 years. 

The longer your term is, the higher your life insurance premiums will be. If you die during the term, your beneficiaries must file a claim with the insurance company. If the insurer approves it, your beneficiaries will receive a tax-free cash payout, or death benefit. This money can be used for anything, from replacing your income to covering funeral costs to paying off debts like a mortgage or student loans. If you outlive the policy term, the policy expires, and no payout is made.

Benefits of Term Life Insurance
Affordable premiums: Term life is often significantly cheaper than whole life insurance. In fact, for a 40-year-old man with excellent health, the average term policy costs as little as $27 per month for a 30-year term policy with a $250,000 death benefit, according to quotes gathered by Investopedia. For a woman with a similar age and health profile, it’s $22 per month. These same applicants could potentially pay hundreds of dollars more for a whole life policy with the same amount of coverage.
Simplicity of coverage: Term life insurance is about as simple as it gets when it comes to insurance. You pay a premium for a term that lasts a set number of years, and if you die during that term, your beneficiaries will be paid a death benefit. There are no additional components or accounts to manage. 
Coverage flexibility: You can choose a term that corresponds with the length of any debt obligations you might have. For example, if you have a 30-year mortgage, you can opt for a 30-year term policy to ensure your family can pay off the house if you die during the term. 
Investment flexibility: Term life can free up money for other investments. The savings compared to whole life could go into an individual retirement account (IRA) or your 401(k). While whole life policies with cash value can grow in value over time, your gains might be limited compared to investing in an index fund.
Drawbacks of Term Life Insurance
No cash value or investment component: Unlike whole life or other types of permanent life insurance policies, term life does not accumulate cash value that you can use for your own retirement income or estate planning needs. If you outlive the policy term, you get nothing back from what you paid to keep it active. You can add a return of premium rider—albeit for a much higher cost—to your term life policy to get some or all of your premiums back at the end of your term.
Limited coverage duration: Once the policy term ends, so does your life insurance coverage. If you still need life insurance, you can renew the policy or purchase a new one, but remember that this will likely be more expensive due to your older age and the additional health risks associated with it.
High renewal costs: Term life insurance premiums are fixed for the duration of the term, but if you renew your coverage after your current policy expires, you could face a sharp increase in premiums.
Who Should Consider Term Life Insurance?
Term life insurance is designed to provide a financial safety net to families for specific periods when financial obligations are at their highest—such as while raising children or while paying down a mortgage or other debts that could outlive you should you die during the policy term. For example:

Young families: If you have young children, a 20- or 30-year term policy ensures they can afford an education and maintain their standard of living until they’re old enough to support themselves.
Homeowners: If you have a mortgage, a term life insurance policy that extends up until or beyond the mortgage term can help ensure your family can pay off the home if you die before it's paid off.
Debt holders: If you have significant personal debts, such as a student loan or credit card debt, the death benefit from a term life insurance policy can help to cover those obligations.
Note
Your loved ones won’t inherit debt unless they’re co-signers, but creditors may make claims against your estate.

Whole Life Insurance: Lifetime Protection With Cash Value
Whole life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance that provides coverage until you die or until you stop paying your premiums. In addition to the payout to your family, it comes with a cash component that grows at a guaranteed rate and that you can access while you’re still alive.

Because whole life insurance comes with cash value and is much more likely to pay out, the cost of coverage is much higher than that of term life insurance. And while you’re free to borrow against or withdraw from your policy’s cash value during your lifetime, doing either comes with potential risks.

Benefits of Whole Life Insurance
Lifelong protection: Unlike term life, whole life insurance policies do not expire. As long as you make regular premium payments and the policy doesn’t lapse, your beneficiaries will receive a death benefit when you die.
Cash value feature: The cash value component of whole life insurance grows over time on a tax-deferred basis. You can borrow against the accumulated cash value or withdraw from it, often tax-free, for expenses like college tuition, home repairs, or retirement income.
Fixed premiums for life: Whole life insurance features a level premium, meaning your premiums are fixed for the duration of the policy. And since the coverage lasts as long as you live (or stop paying premiums), you don’t need to worry about renewing it for potentially higher costs as you would with a term policy.
Tax advantages: The cash value part of whole life policies grows on a tax-deferred basis. If you decide to take out loans or withdraw against the death benefit, those are also generally tax-free unless the amount is more than you’ve paid in premiums. The death benefit is also tax-free for your beneficiaries.

Drawbacks of Whole Life Insurance
Higher premiums: Whole life insurance is significantly more expensive than term life insurance. A $500,000 whole life policy for a 35-year-old man can cost more than $500 per month.

Coverage complexity: For those who are less familiar with how life insurance and financial planning work, a whole life policy’s cash value, dividends, and policy loan components can be challenging to understand and manage. 
Low rate of return: You may gain more by purchasing an affordable term life policy and depositing the difference into your emergency fund or a self-funded investment or retirement account.
Surrender charges for early cancellation: If you decide to cancel your whole life policy within the first 10 to 15 years that it’s in force, your insurance company may hit you with surrender charges that can reduce any accompanying cash value you receive after terminating the policy. You’ll also be taxed on the cash you receive from surrendering the policy.

Who Should Consider Whole Life Insurance?
Whole life insurance may be a good option if you want lifelong income protection for your beneficiaries and the flexibility to tap into the accumulated cash value while you’re still alive. Overall, whole life insurance is best for the following demographics or circumstances:

High-net-worth individuals: If you own a significant amount in assets, whole life insurance can provide a tax-free way to transfer it to your heirs when you die. It could also offer another way to save for retirement if you’ve maxed out your 401(k).
Parents of disabled children: If you have a dependent with disabilities who requires lifelong financial support and in-person care, a whole life insurance policy can provide a financial safety net to ensure their needs are met long after you’re gone.
Small business owners: If you own a small business, whole life insurance can help with succession planning. The payout can allow your partners to buy your shares as part of a buy-sell agreement. It can also help cover estate taxes and other transition costs, ensuring the business continues without you.
Which Policy Is Right for You?
To determine whether a term life or whole life policy is best for you and your circumstances, consider the following.

Your Budget
Your budget is one of the most significant factors when choosing between term and whole life insurance. Term life insurance is much more affordable, making it a better choice for those who need coverage but have limited funds. Whole life insurance is more expensive but provides you with coverage until you die and a cash value component that can serve as a financial tool.

Your Long-Term Financial Goals
Your long-term financial goals should also play a role in your decision. If you’re just looking for a simple, affordable way to protect your family during a specific period, term life insurance may be the best choice. However, if you want to build cash value over time and have lifelong coverage, whole life insurance may be more appropriate. 

Your Retirement Planning Needs
The cash value component of whole life insurance can also supplement your retirement savings. While not a replacement for a 401(k) or IRA, the cash value from a whole life policy can provide you with additional tax-deferred retirement income. If you’ve already maxed out your IRA or 401(k) contributions and have more money you’d like to allocate toward retirement, a whole life policy could add a much-needed layer of stability and diversification to your portfolio.

Converting Term to Whole Life Insurance: Is It the Right Move?
If you find the affordability of term life insurance appealing but want the flexibility to convert it to permanent coverage as your life or financial circumstances change, you may want to consider a convertible term life insurance policy. 

A convertible term policy lets you convert your term life insurance into a whole life policy without undergoing a medical exam. This can be beneficial if your financial situation changes or you develop health issues down the line that make it more challenging to be approved for a new term or whole life policy.

Benefits of Term Life Conversion
Coverage flexibility: You can start with cheaper coverage and transition to permanent coverage later. This is helpful if you expect your income to rise or worry about future health problems making it hard to get insurance.
No medical exam: When you convert your term life policy to whole life, you typically do not need a new health evaluation or medical exam, which can be a crucial win if your health declines.
Premiums are locked in: Whole life policies have fixed premiums, so converting early may help you secure a more favorable rate.
Drawbacks of Term Life Conversion
Potentially higher costs: Whole life insurance is significantly more expensive than term. So while the no-medical-exam feature of a conversion policy may guarantee you’ll be approved at a predetermined rate if you convert to a whole life policy, the rate you end up with will still be significantly higher than if you renewed or purchased a new term policy.
Limited conversion period: Many policies have conversion deadlines, so you’ll need to decide ahead of time whether to convert to a permanent policy.
Who Should Consider a Term to Permanent Life Conversion?
People with changing financial situations: If your financial outlook has improved and you can afford higher premiums, converting to whole life may be a good option.
Those with current or future health concerns: If your health is declining or your family has a history of health issues, a convertible term policy can help you maintain coverage without taking a new medical exam.
Families with potential long-term care needs: If your family requires lifelong financial support but you can’t afford whole life insurance right now, a convertible term policy gives you time. When you can afford it, you can switch to whole life, ensuring your family’s long-term needs are met.
The Bottom Line
Both term and whole life insurance offer a safety net for your family, but they work in different ways. Term life is an affordable option for temporary coverage, while whole life provides lifelong protection and builds cash value, but at a higher cost. The best choice depends on your financial goals, budget, and long-term needs.
