Life Insurance Basics
=====================

**Definition and purpose**

- Life insurance is a contract between an insurer and a policy owner that guarantees a sum of money – called the *death benefit* – to named beneficiaries when the insured dieshttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=Life%20insurance%20is%20a%20contract,beneficiaries%20when%20the%20insured%20dies.  By paying regular premiums, a policyholder obtains a financial safety net for their family: if the insured dies while the policy is active, the insurer pays the death benefit to the beneficiaries.  This money can help replace lost income and cover expenses such as housing, food, outstanding debts, or funeral costshttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=Life%20insurance%20is%20a%20contract,beneficiaries%20when%20the%20insured%20dies.
- The death benefit can also be used to leave a legacy for loved ones or charities.  Because the benefit is generally income‑tax‑free, it can be a hassle‑free source of funds for beneficiarieshttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=Death%20Benefit.

**Key takeaways**

- Life insurance policies require the policyholder to make regular premium payments.  In exchange, the insurer promises to pay the death benefit if the insured dies during the policy periodhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways.
- **Term life insurance** provides affordable coverage for a specific period (e.g., 10, 20 or 30 years) and typically has the lowest premiums.  **Permanent life insurance** (such as whole or universal life) provides lifelong protection and includes a cash‑value component that can grow over timehttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways.  Premiums are determined by factors such as age, health, lifestyle and coverage amount; younger and healthier individuals generally pay lower rateshttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=,healthier%20individuals%20paying%20lower%20rates.

**Roles and components**

- The **policyholder** owns the policy and pays the premiums.  The **beneficiary** is the person or entity designated to receive the death benefit.  A policy can have multiple beneficiaries, including family members, friends or charitieshttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=Policyholder%20and%20Beneficiary.  Insurance companies require the purchaser to have an *insurable interest* in the life insured – meaning they would face financial hardship if the insured diedhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=Policyholder%20and%20Beneficiary.
- **Premiums** are the regular payments required to keep the policy active.  They are based on the policyholder’s age, health, lifestyle and the amount of coverage; permanent policies cost more than term policieshttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=Premiums.
- The **death benefit** is the money paid to beneficiaries when the insured dies.  Beneficiaries can choose to receive the payout as a lump sum, in instalments over time, as a lifetime income, or as interest‑only payments with the principal payable to a secondary beneficiary laterhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=Death%20Benefit.  The death benefit can be used for any purpose and is generally tax‑freehttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=The%20death%20benefit%20can%20be,free%20financial%20resource%20for%20beneficiaries.2.
- To receive the death benefit, beneficiaries must file a claim with the insurance company and provide necessary documents such as the death certificate and the policy.  Once approved, the insurer typically pays the benefit within about 30 dayshttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=Claims%20Process.

**Types of life insurance**

- **Term life insurance** provides coverage for a specified period and pays out only if the insured dies during that period.  It is typically the most affordable type of life insurance and does not accumulate cash valuehttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20main%20types,a%20savings%20or%20investment%20component.
- **Permanent life insurance**, including whole life and universal life, provides coverage for the insured’s entire life (as long as premiums are paid).  These policies include a savings or investment component that builds cash value over time, which can be borrowed against or withdrawnhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=Permanent%20Life%20Insurance.

Life insurance serves as a foundational tool for financial planning.  It protects survivors against the financial risk of a breadwinner’s death and can provide liquidity, tax advantages and, in the case of permanent policies, an additional savings component.
