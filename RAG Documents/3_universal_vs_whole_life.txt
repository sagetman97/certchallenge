Universal vs. Whole Life Insurance
=================================

Both universal life and whole life are types of *permanent* life insurance.  They provide lifetime coverage and include a cash‑value component, but they differ in how premiums, death benefits and cash values work.

**Key differences**

- *Flexibility vs. guarantees:* Universal life (UL) insurance gives policyholders flexibility in premium payments, death benefits and the savings element of their policies, whereas whole life insurance offers consistent premiums and guaranteed cash‑value accumulation and death benefithttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/whole_universal.asp#:~:text=have%20some%20key%20differences,1.
- *Premiums and death benefits:* UL premiums can be increased or decreased (within limits) and death benefits can be adjusted; whole life premiums are fixed and the death benefit is guaranteed as long as premiums are paidhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/whole_universal.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways.
- *Cash‑value growth:* UL cash value grows based on interest rates and may fluctuate with market conditions, while whole life cash value grows at a guaranteed rate and may receive dividendshttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/whole_universal.asp#:~:text=have%20some%20key%20differences,1.  Because UL has fewer guarantees, its premiums are generally lower, but the policy may become underfunded and lapse if not monitoredhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/whole_universal.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeawayshttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/whole_universal.asp#:~:text=The%20biggest%20difference%20for%20policyholders,universal%20life%20is%20the%20guarantees.

**Whole life insurance features**

- Whole life covers you for the rest of your life, provided you pay the premiums.  Part of each premium goes into a high‑interest savings or investment account, causing the cash value to increase on a tax‑deferred basishttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/whole_universal.asp#:~:text=Whole%20life%20insurance%20covers%20you,death%20expenses%20like%20estate%20taxes.
- Policyholders can borrow against the accumulated cash value or surrender the policy for its cash value; some policies pay dividends that can be taken as cash, left to accumulate interest, used to reduce premiums or purchase additional coveragehttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/whole_universal.asp#:~:text=Pros%20and%20Cons%20of%20Whole,Life%20Insurance.
- Because of the guarantees and living benefits, whole life policies are expensive compared with other types of life insurancehttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/whole_universal.asp#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20level%20premiums%2C%20fixed,it%20in%20the%20long%20term.

**Universal life insurance features**

- Universal life (sometimes called adjustable life) also provides lifelong coverage but offers premium flexibility.  A portion of each premium goes into an investment account that earns interest; you can adjust the death benefit and, once enough cash value has accumulated, even use it to pay premiumshttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/whole_universal.asp#:~:text=Universal%20Life%20Insurance.
- Policyholders can partially withdraw or borrow from the cash value.  However, interest rates are often tied to market performance, and poor performance can cause the policy to become underfunded, raising premiums or causing the policy to lapsehttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/whole_universal.asp#:~:text=Pros%20and%20Cons%20of%20Universal,Life%20Insurance.
- Fees and surrender charges may apply if you terminate the policy or withdraw funds, especially in the early yearshttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/whole_universal.asp#:~:text=Another%20downside%20of%20universal%20life,that%20might%20increase%20your%20premiums.  Because UL lacks guarantees, it tends to have lower premiums than whole life but requires active management.

**Summary**

Whole life provides guarantees – fixed premiums, guaranteed cash‑value growth and guaranteed death benefit – at a higher cost.  Universal life offers flexibility in premiums and death benefits and the potential for higher returns, but it has fewer guarantees and can lapse if underfundedhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/whole_universal.asp#:~:text=Key%20Differences.  Choosing between them depends on whether the client values certainty or flexibility.
