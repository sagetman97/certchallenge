Life Insurance in a Diversified Portfolio
========================================

Traditional investment portfolios focus on stocks, bonds, real estate and other market‑based assets.  Life insurance, particularly permanent life insurance, can also play a strategic role in portfolio construction by adding protection, diversification and tax benefits.

- **Complementing a portfolio:** Life insurance is generally thought of as a way to protect loved ones, but it can also complement fixed‑income assets and help moderate risk and volatility in a portfoliohttps://dbs-lifemark.com/consider-life-insurance-as-an-asset-in-a-diversified-portfolio/#:~:text=Consider%20Life%20Insurance%20as%20an,Asset%20in%20a%20Diversified%20Portfolio.
- **Expected value:** Paying a specific premium ensures a known death benefit that will be paid whether the insured dies tomorrow or decades later.  This predictable, sometimes guaranteed value can be useful in estate planning, for example, when equalizing assets among heirs in a family businesshttps://dbs-lifemark.com/consider-life-insurance-as-an-asset-in-a-diversified-portfolio/#:~:text=Life%20Insurance%20Provides%20an%20Expected,case%20of%20a%20family%20business.
- **Non‑correlation to markets:** Many portfolios are exposed to market volatility.  The death benefit and, in many cases, the cash value of life insurance are not correlated to market performance, providing diversificationhttps://dbs-lifemark.com/consider-life-insurance-as-an-asset-in-a-diversified-portfolio/#:~:text=Many%20asset%20portfolios%20are%20comprised,seen%20as%20a%20smart%20move.
- **Immediate liquidity:** Individuals often own illiquid assets like businesses or real estate.  Life insurance provides immediate liquidity at death, and certain permanent policies allow access to cash value while the insured is alivehttps://dbs-lifemark.com/consider-life-insurance-as-an-asset-in-a-diversified-portfolio/#:~:text=Life%20Insurance%20Provides%20Immediate%20Liquidity,alive%2C%20should%20the%20need%20arise.
- **Tax benefits:** Cash values in permanent life insurance policies may grow tax‑deferred and death benefits are generally income‑tax‑free.  Properly structured policies can also help avoid estate taxeshttps://dbs-lifemark.com/consider-life-insurance-as-an-asset-in-a-diversified-portfolio/#:~:text=Life%20Insurance%20Provides%20Tax%20Benefits,insurance%20can%20avoid%20estate%20taxes.
- **Client communication:** Life insurance may be better appreciated when advisors frame it using the vocabulary of portfolio management and risk mitigationhttps://dbs-lifemark.com/consider-life-insurance-as-an-asset-in-a-diversified-portfolio/#:~:text=Life%20insurance%20can%20be%20problematic,which%20consumers%20already%20manage%20their.

In summary, life insurance can function as an asset class that stabilizes portfolio performance, provides tax‑efficient liquidity and enhances estate planning.  Advisors should consider it alongside traditional investments when seeking diversification and risk management.
