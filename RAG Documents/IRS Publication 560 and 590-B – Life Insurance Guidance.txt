📘 IRS Publication 560 and 590-B – Life Insurance Guidance for RAG Systems (2024 Edition)
🔹 Publication 560: Retirement Plans for Small Business (SEP, SIMPLE, and Qualified Plans)
🔸 Purpose
Provides guidance on setting up and administering tax-advantaged retirement plans for small business owners and self-employed individuals. Covers:

SEP (Simplified Employee Pension)

SIMPLE IRA (Savings Incentive Match Plan)

Qualified Plans (e.g., profit-sharing, 401(k), defined benefit plans)

🔸 Key Relevance to Life Insurance
While IRAs themselves cannot hold life insurance, certain employer-sponsored qualified retirement plans (QRPs) can include life insurance policies under strict limitations:

Life insurance may be held inside a qualified plan (not IRA), but only as an “incidental benefit” (IRC §401(a), Treas. Reg. §1.401-1(b)(1)(i))

🔹 “Incidental Benefit” Rule (from Treas. Reg. §1.401-1(b)(1)(i))
This rule outlines how much life insurance a qualified plan (e.g., defined benefit or profit-sharing) may hold:

Whole Life Insurance: premiums must not exceed 50% of total annual contributions made to the participant’s account.

Term/Universal Life Insurance: premiums must not exceed 25% of total annual contributions.

Purpose: Ensure retirement income remains the primary objective—not insurance accumulation.

RAG Note: Advisors may ask whether a qualified plan can include life insurance. The answer is yes only under the “incidental benefit” rule.

🔸 SEP and SIMPLE IRAs – Life Insurance Prohibition
SEP IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs are IRAs, so:

No life insurance is permitted as an investment inside these accounts (IRC §408(a)(3))

Employers can’t contribute toward life insurance premiums within SEP/SIMPLE contributions.

IRS Pub 560 redirects readers to Pub 590-B for prohibited investments.

RAG Output Example:

“No, life insurance policies—including term, whole, and universal life—cannot be held in SEP or SIMPLE IRAs. This restriction is outlined in IRS Publication 560 and enforced under IRC Section 408(a)(3).”

📗 Publication 590-B: Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
🔸 Purpose
Covers how distributions from Traditional, Roth, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs are taxed and when they must begin.

🔹 Life Insurance as a Prohibited IRA Investment
Under IRC §408(a)(3) and (m), and clarified by Pub 590-B:

IRAs may not invest in life insurance contracts.

Prohibited investments include:

Whole Life Insurance

Term Life Insurance

Universal Life

Variable Life Insurance

Life insurance riders

This includes both owning the contract or using IRA funds to pay premiums.

Exception:

Small incidental group-term policies provided by employer outside the IRA structure may be allowed, if not held by the IRA.

🔸 Prohibited Transaction Rules (Pub 590-B, Chapter 2)
Using IRA funds to:

Buy a life insurance policy

Pay for premiums

Assign IRA as policy owner or beneficiary
...is considered a prohibited transaction (IRC §4975), causing:

Immediate disqualification of the IRA

Entire IRA treated as distributed

Taxable income + 10% penalty (if under age 59½)

RAG Output Example:

“If IRA funds are used to pay for life insurance, it constitutes a prohibited transaction under IRC §4975. The IRA will lose its tax-deferred status and be considered fully distributed and taxable.”

🔸 Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) – No Exception for Insurance
Starting at age 73, Traditional IRAs must begin RMDs.

There is no provision to defer or reduce RMDs based on holding life insurance externally.

Life insurance cannot be used to satisfy an RMD, nor does a death benefit substitute for a required withdrawal.

🔹 Inherited IRAs and Life Insurance
Life insurance proceeds paid to a beneficiary do not impact IRA RMD requirements.

Beneficiaries of both must separately:

Withdraw from inherited IRA (under 10-year rule or life expectancy)

Handle death benefit from policy as non-taxable (IRC §101(a))

RAG Output Example:

“Even if a beneficiary receives a life insurance death benefit, it does not affect RMD obligations for an inherited IRA.”

✅ Sample RAG-Ready Q&A Based on These Publications
Q: Can I hold a life insurance policy in my Roth IRA?
A: No. Roth IRAs are governed by IRC §408, which prohibits life insurance contracts from being held as investments. This is outlined in IRS Pub 590-B.

Q: Can my employer-sponsored 401(k) include life insurance?
A: Yes, if structured as a qualified retirement plan—not an IRA. Life insurance is allowed as an “incidental benefit” if premiums stay within 25–50% thresholds (Treas. Reg. §1.401-1(b)(1)(i); IRS Pub 560).

Q: Can I use IRA money to buy life insurance for estate planning?
A: No. That would be a prohibited transaction under IRC §4975. You must fund life insurance premiums from non-IRA assets.

Q: If I inherit an IRA and a life insurance policy, can one offset the other?
A: No. IRAs and life insurance are separate. RMDs from an inherited IRA must be taken regardless of any death benefit received from insurance.
