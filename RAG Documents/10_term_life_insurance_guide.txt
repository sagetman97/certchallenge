Term Life Insurance Guide
=======================

Term life insurance is the simplest form of life insurance.  It provides coverage for a specific period and pays a death benefit only if the insured dies within that term.

- **Basic structure:** With a term policy, you agree to pay premiums for a set term (usually 10–30 years), and the insurance company promises to pay a death benefit if you die during that period.  Term policies do not build cash value and expire at the end of the termhttps://www.guardianlife.com/life-insurance/how-term-life-works#:~:text=A%20term%20life%20insurance%20policy,to%20your%20beneficiary%20or%20beneficiaries.
- **Application and underwriting:** Before issuing the policy, the insurer assesses your risk through a medical exam and questions about your occupation and lifestyle.  The cost of coverage varies based on these factors and the term lengthhttps://www.guardianlife.com/life-insurance/how-term-life-works#:~:text=How%20term%20life%20insurance%20works.
- **Choosing term length and benefit:** Policyholders choose a term length that aligns with their needs (e.g., covering a mortgage or child‑rearing years) and select a death‑benefit amount that will support their beneficiaries.  Beneficiaries can include individuals or charities and can be split among multiple peoplehttps://www.guardianlife.com/life-insurance/how-term-life-works#:~:text=,the%20house%20and%20through%20college.

**Types of term policies**

- **Level premium (level term):** The most common type; the premium stays the same for the entire termhttps://www.guardianlife.com/life-insurance/how-term-life-works#:~:text=,same%20for%20the%20entire%20term.
- **Yearly renewable term (annual renewable):** Covers you for one year at a time with an option to renew without a medical exam, but the premium increases each yearhttps://www.guardianlife.com/life-insurance/how-term-life-works#:~:text=,with%20a%20level%20premium%20policy.
- **Return of premium:** Refunds all or part of the premiums if you outlive the term; however, premiums may be 2–5 times higher than a standard level term policyhttps://www.guardianlife.com/life-insurance/how-term-life-works#:~:text=,2.
- **Guaranteed issue:** Requires no medical exam; premiums are higher and the full death benefit may not be payable for the first few yearshttps://www.guardianlife.com/life-insurance/how-term-life-works#:~:text=of%20your%20premiums%20if%20you,2.

**Benefits of term life**

Term life insurance is generally the most cost‑effective way to obtain significant coverage.  Because it lacks a cash‑value component, premiums are lower than those of permanent life insurancehttps://www.guardianlife.com/life-insurance/how-term-life-works#:~:text=Benefits%20of%20Guardian%20level%20term,life%20insurance.
