Estate Planning & Life Insurance
================================

When planning for estate taxes, advisers often overlook that life‑insurance proceeds can become part of a taxable estate. While death benefits are generally received income‑tax free, they may still be included in the estate if the estate itself is the beneficiary or if the insured retains “incidents of ownership.”  Incidents of ownership include the right to change beneficiaries, assign or pledge the policy as collateral, borrow against it or surrender the policy.  If the decedent held any of these rights at death, the entire death benefit and any accumulated cash value will be pulled into the taxable estatehttps://www.gislason.com/life-insurance-and-the-taxable-estate/#:~:text=An%20often%20overlooked%20component%20of,minimize%20or%20eliminate%20estate%20tax.

The estate‑inclusion risks can be mitigated through careful planning.  One option is to ensure someone other than the insured owns the policy.  A buy‑sell agreement for a business, for example, can be structured as a cross‑purchase so that each owner buys insurance on the other, or an entity purchase where the business buys insurance on the owners.  Another strategy is to create an irrevocable life‑insurance trust (ILIT).  The insured can gift the policy to an ILIT, removing incidents of ownership and thereby excluding the death benefit from the estate.  However, under the “three‑year rule” the insured must live at least three years after transferring ownership; otherwise the proceeds are pulled back into the estate.  Naming an ILIT as beneficiary also allows trust provisions to control distribution of the proceeds and potentially avoid estate taxeshttps://www.gislason.com/life-insurance-and-the-taxable-estate/#:~:text=Buy,in%20the%20first%20partner%E2%80%99s%20estate.

For clients with large estates, advisers should review who owns the policy and who is named as beneficiary.  Policies owned by spouses or trusts typically avoid estate inclusion.  If the insured needs access to cash value for emergencies, the ILIT can be structured to allow loans.  These strategies help ensure that life‑insurance proceeds meet the client’s objectives without triggering unintended estate‑tax liabilitieshttps://www.gislason.com/life-insurance-and-the-taxable-estate/#:~:text=An%20often%20overlooked%20component%20of,minimize%20or%20eliminate%20estate%20tax.
