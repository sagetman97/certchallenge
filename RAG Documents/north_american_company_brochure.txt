1. Premiums are guaranteed to remain level for the initial 10, 15, 20, or 30 year period. After the premium guarantee period, premiums will increase annually but will never exceed the Guaranteed Annual
Renewal Premium.
2. Subject to eligibility requirements.
An administration fee is required at time of election of an accelerated death benefit. The face amount will be reduced by the accelerated death benefit amount. Since benefits are paid prior to death,
a discount will be applied to the face amount accelerated. As a result, the actual amount received will be less than the amount of face amount accelerated.
The death benefit will be reduced by the amount of the death benefit accelerated. Since benefits are paid prior to death, a discount will be applied to the death benefit accelerated. As a result, the
actual amount received will be less than the amount of the death benefit accelerated.
3. Subject to premium payment requirements.
4. The Premium Recovery Endorsement is only available if the Premium Guarantee Rider is selected. If your client previously elected to accelerate the death benefit, the total premiums will also be
reduced by the same portion that the death benefit was reduced at the time of that election. The Premium Recovery Endorsement will remain in effect to the 25-year policy anniversary as long as
the qualification test is satisfied at each policy anniversary. Generally, the qualification test is met if the gross premiums paid guarantee the policy to at least the insured’s attained age of 95, assuming
no policy loans are taken. In some instances, additional premium may be required based on underwriting class, table ratings, or flat extras. If the Premium Recovery Endorsement terminates, it cannot
be reinstated.
5. Allows policyowner the right to exchange policy, without evidence of insurability and surrender charges, to one of our cash value accumulation indexed universal life policies available at the time
of exchange. The Cash Surrender Value on the new policy may not be greater than the Cash Surrender Value on the policy being exchanged. Not available for policy ages 76 and above or if there is
an outstanding policy loan.
6. Surrender charges will not be waived if the policy is surrendered under an external 1035 exchange (except in FL). A decrease charge will be assessed if a reduction in the specified amount is requested
during the waiver of surrender charge period. However, if a partial withdrawal results in a reduction of the specified amount, the withdrawal charge is waived. There is an additional charge for this
rider and it must be applied for at the time of application.
7. Protection Builder IUL 2: The current interest bonus for the Fidelity Multifactor Yield IndexSM 5% ER is 1% which is added to the then current interest rate. The index bonus is applied after the
participation rate, cap, floor and spread. This bonus is not applied to any loaned amount. The current interest bonus percentages are not guaranteed and subject to change; however, once a policy
is issued, the guaranteed percentage will not change. No other index options offer a bonus.
Builder Plus IUL 4: Conditionally Guaranteed Interest Bonus on Fixed Account - If we are crediting interest in excess of the guaranteed interest rate and your client’s policy is in effect after the 10th
policy anniversary, your client’s policy will receive an interest bonus. The current interest bonus is 0.50% above the then current interest rate. The interest bonus percentages are not guaranteed and
subject to change; however, once a policy is issued, the percentage will not change. This bonus is not applied to any loaned amount.
Builder Plus IUL 4 for the Fidelity Multifactor IndexSM 5% ER Vol Control: Interest Bonus on Index Account - The current interest bonus for the Fidelity Vol Control Index is 1% above the then
current interest rate through policy year 10. If your client’s policy is in effect after the 10th policy anniversary, the current interest bonus is 1.50% for the Fidelity Vol Control Index and is .50% for all
other index selections above the then current interest rate. The index bonus is applied after the participation rate, cap, floor and spread. This bonus is not applied to any loaned amount. The interest
bonus percentages are not guaranteed and subject to change; however, once a policy is issued, the guaranteed percentage will not change.
8. The net cost of a variable interest participating policy loan could be negative if the credits earned are less than the interest charged. The net cost of the loan could also be larger than under standard
policy loans if the amount credited is less than the interest charged. In the extreme example, the amount credited could be zero and the net cost of the loan would equal the maximum interest rate
charged on variable interest participating policy loans. In brief, Variable Interest Participating Policy Loans have more uncertainty than Standard Policy Loans in both the interest rate charged and the
interest rate credited.
9. Net Zero Cost Loans are loans charged and credited at the same interest rate percentage for a net zero cost. The policy year and amount available vary by product. Please refer to the specific
product marketing guide for details.
10. The policy will remain in effect when extensive loans are taken provided the policy is not terminated due to surrender and the policy owner does not take policy loans or withdrawals during the
Overloan Protection period. This benefit may reduce the Specified Amount and will terminate the Protected Death Benefit. If Over loan Protection benefit is in effect, Accelerated Benefit riders
cannot be elected. The Overloan Protection Benefit cannot be elected if the Protected Death Benefit is in effect.
11. If the policy has a Premium Guarantee Rider attached to it, such rider will be terminated upon the election of the Protected Death Benefit. The Protected Death Benefit cannot be elected if the
Over loan Protection Benefit is in effect.
12. The net cost of a Fixed Interest Participating Policy Loan could be negative if the credits earned are less than the interest charged. The net cost of the loan could also be larger than under standard
policy loans if the amount credited is less than the interest charged. In the extreme example, the amount credited could be zero and the net cost of the loan would equal the maximum interest rate
charged less any guaranteed bonus. In brief, fixed interest rate loans have more uncertainty than standard policy loans in the interest rate credited.
The current interest bonus on money allocated for a Fixed Interest Participating Policy Loan is 2% for years 3+. There is no bonus on money allocated to any other loan type. The interest bonus
percentages are not guaranteed and subject to change; however, once a policy is issued, the guaranteed percentage will not change.
13. In some situations loans and withdrawals may be subject to federal taxes. North American does not give tax or legal advice. Clients should be instructed to consult with and rely on their own tax
advisor or attorney for advice on their specific situation.
14. Subject to eligibility requirements. The maximum issue age is 70. Not allowed if the primary insured has a table rating greater than 4 or a flat extra rating.Indexed Universal Life insurance products
are not an investment in the “market” or in the applicable index and are subject to all policy fees and charges normally associated with most universal life insurance.
