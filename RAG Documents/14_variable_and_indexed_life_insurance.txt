Variable, Indexed and Special‑Purpose Life Insurance Policies
============================================================

Overview
--------

Beyond term and whole life, there are several **flexible and investment‑oriented life‑insurance policies** that blend insurance protection with market‑linked cash‑value growth.  Understanding how these products work, and their relative risks and benefits, is essential when advising clients who view life insurance as part of their broader investment strategy.

Variable Life Insurance
----------------------

A **variable life insurance policy** allocates most of the premium to **separate investment accounts**, allowing the policyholder to choose from options such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and money‑market fundshttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/variable_universal.asp#:~:text=Variable%20Life%20Insurance%20vs,Universal%20Life%20Insurance%3A%20An%20Overview.  The death benefit and cash value **fluctuate with investment performance**, providing upside potential but exposing the policy to market riskhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/variable_universal.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways.

*Key features*

- **Investment options:** Policyholders can select from a wide range of investments, often managed by professional asset managershttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/variable_universal.asp#:~:text=Variable%20Life%20Insurance.
- **Tax‑deferred growth:** Cash value accumulates tax‑deferred and can be used to pay premiumshttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/variable_universal.asp#:~:text=,value%2C%20which%20reduces%20premium%20payments.
- **Death‑benefit options:** Some variable policies allow the beneficiary to receive either a fixed face value or the face value plus the accumulated cash value, though this increases premiumshttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/variable_universal.asp#:~:text=typically%20choose%20from%20one%20of,a%20fixed%20death%20benefit%20option.
- **Regulation and cost:** Because these policies invest in securities, they are regulated and typically have higher fees and surrender chargeshttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/variable_universal.asp#:~:text=Disadvantages.

Variable Universal Life (VUL)
----------------------------

A **variable universal life (VUL) policy** combines variable investing with the flexibility of universal life.  Like a variable life policy, a VUL offers **market‑linked subaccounts**, but it also allows the policyholder to **adjust premium payments and death benefits** within certain limitshttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/variable_universal.asp#:~:text=Variable%20Universal%20Life%20.  Advantages include flexible premiums, available cash value and a variety of investment optionshttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/variable_universal.asp#:~:text=Advantages%20and%20Disadvantages%20of%20Variable,Universal%20Life.  However, VUL policies are **riskier and more expensive** than standard policies and require careful management to avoid lapseshttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/variable_universal.asp#:~:text=Disadvantages.

Indexed Universal Life (IUL)
---------------------------

An **indexed universal life (IUL) policy** credits interest to the cash‑value account based on the performance of an underlying **equity index** (e.g., the S&P 500).  These policies offer **flexible premium payments** and provide a minimum guaranteed interest rate while capping the maximum credited rate.  Key takeaways from a comparison between whole life and IUL includehttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/012616/index-universal-life-vs-whole-life-insurance-how-they-compare.asp#:~:text=value%20grows%20by%20a%20guaranteed,2:

- **Fixed vs. indexed growth:** Whole life policies have fixed premiums and guaranteed cash‑value growth, whereas IUL policies allow flexible payments and link cash accumulation to an equity indexhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/012616/index-universal-life-vs-whole-life-insurance-how-they-compare.asp#:~:text=value%20grows%20by%20a%20guaranteed,2.
- **Upside potential and risk:** IULs offer higher upside potential than whole life but are more complex and riskier; returns depend on index performance and are subject to caps and floorshttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/012616/index-universal-life-vs-whole-life-insurance-how-they-compare.asp#:~:text=Indexed%20Universal%20Life%20Insurance.
- **Minimum guarantees and caps:** Even if the market index declines, IUL policies credit a minimum rate, but they also cap the maximum credited returnhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/012616/index-universal-life-vs-whole-life-insurance-how-they-compare.asp#:~:text=While%20having%20your%20investments%20tied,4.
- **Pros and cons:** Advantages include flexible premiums and the ability to borrow against the cash valuehttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/012616/index-universal-life-vs-whole-life-insurance-how-they-compare.asp#:~:text=The%20Pros.  Drawbacks include potential premium increases, higher expenses and the possibility that poor investment performance could reduce the cash value or death benefithttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/012616/index-universal-life-vs-whole-life-insurance-how-they-compare.asp#:~:text=,premium%20payments%20lag%20behind%20performance.

Final Expense and Survivorship Policies
--------------------------------------

*Final expense insurance* is a small whole life policy designed to cover **funeral costs, final medical bills and outstanding debts**.  It pays a relatively modest death benefit and can accrue cash valuehttps://www.investopedia.com/types-of-life-insurance-plans-and-how-to-decide-which-one-is-right-for-you-7482251#:~:text=Final%20Expense%20Insurance.

*Survivorship (second‑to‑die) life insurance* is a joint policy that pays a death benefit only after **both insured individuals have died**.  It is often used for estate‑planning strategies or to leave an inheritancehttps://www.investopedia.com/types-of-life-insurance-plans-and-how-to-decide-which-one-is-right-for-you-7482251#:~:text=Survivorship%20Life%20Insurance.

Other Variations and Riders
---------------------------

- **Supplemental life insurance** allows employees to purchase additional coverage beyond their employer‑provided group policyhttps://www.investopedia.com/types-of-life-insurance-plans-and-how-to-decide-which-one-is-right-for-you-7482251#:~:text=Supplemental%20Life%20Insurance.
- **Riders** (policy add‑ons) enable customization, such as **accidental death & dismemberment**, **critical illness**, **chronic illness** or **long‑term‑care benefits**https://www.investopedia.com/types-of-life-insurance-plans-and-how-to-decide-which-one-is-right-for-you-7482251#:~:text=Life%20insurance%20plans%20can%20be,you%20might%20not%20otherwise%20have.
- When evaluating policies with cash value, it is important to consider how **withdrawals or loans may affect the death benefit** and that gains withdrawn may be taxablehttps://www.investopedia.com/types-of-life-insurance-plans-and-how-to-decide-which-one-is-right-for-you-7482251#:~:text=Evaluating%20Cash%20Value%20Options.

Summary
-------

Investment‑linked life‑insurance products offer the possibility of **higher cash‑value growth** than traditional whole life, but they introduce **market risk, higher costs and complexity**.  Advisors should ensure that clients understand the risks, caps and floors of indexed and variable policies and assess whether the potential upside aligns with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  For many households, simpler term or whole life policies may be more appropriate, but these alternative policies can play a role in wealth‑building or estate planning when properly understood.
