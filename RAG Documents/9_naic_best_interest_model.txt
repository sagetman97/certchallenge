NAIC Best‑Interest Model Regulation for Annuities
==============================================

In February 2020 the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) revised its Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation (Model 275), introducing a **best‑interest standard of care** that supersedes the previous suitability standard.  By 2021 several states had already adopted versions of the regulationhttps://dmi.com/blog/your-four-obligations-under-naics-best-interest-model-regulation/#:~:text=Commissioners%20content,adopted%20by%20states%20very%20quickly.

**Purpose and scope**

- The regulation aims to ensure that insurance producers act in the consumer’s best interest when recommending annuity products and do not place their own or the insurance carrier’s interests ahead of the consumer’shttps://dmi.com/blog/your-four-obligations-under-naics-best-interest-model-regulation/#:~:text=Commissioners%20content,adopted%20by%20states%20very%20quickly.

**Four producer obligations**

1. **Care:** Producers must exercise reasonable diligence, care and skill to understand the consumer’s financial situation, insurance needs and objectives.  They must gather sufficient consumer profile information and have a reasonable basis to believe the recommended annuity effectively addresses the consumer’s situationhttps://dmi.com/blog/your-four-obligations-under-naics-best-interest-model-regulation/#:~:text=The%20Model%20Regulation%20requires%20that,conflict%20of%20interest%2C%20and%20documentation.  Producers are not required to consider every annuity on the market, only those they are authorized to sellhttps://dmi.com/blog/your-four-obligations-under-naics-best-interest-model-regulation/#:~:text=The%20Model%20Regulation%20requires%20that,conflict%20of%20interest%2C%20and%20documentation.

2. **Disclosure:** Producers must clearly disclose key information to consumers, including the annuity’s features, the producer’s role and licensure, the range of insurers they represent, and the sources and types of cash and non‑cash compensation they receive.  Consumers must be informed that they have the right to request additional information about compensationhttps://dmi.com/blog/your-four-obligations-under-naics-best-interest-model-regulation/#:~:text=2.

3. **Conflict of interest:** Producers must identify and avoid or reasonably manage any material conflicts of interest and ensure such conflicts do not influence the recommendationhttps://dmi.com/blog/your-four-obligations-under-naics-best-interest-model-regulation/#:~:text=The%20Model%20Regulation%20requires%20that,conflict%20of%20interest%2C%20and%20documentation.

4. **Documentation:** Producers must maintain documentation of the recommendation and the basis for believing the product is in the consumer’s best interest.  Although the article does not detail this step, regulators generally expect documentation of consumer profile information and the analysis performed.

**Implications of the best‑interest standard**

- Under the suitability standard, a producer could recommend any annuity that was simply suitable, even if a different product would better serve the consumer.  Under the best‑interest standard, the producer must analyze the available annuities they can offer and recommend the one that best fits the consumer’s needshttps://dmi.com/blog/your-four-obligations-under-naics-best-interest-model-regulation/#:~:text=An%20Example%E2%80%93%20To%20see%20how,let%E2%80%99s%20consider%20the%20following%20scenario.
- The industry has generally welcomed the model, and states are rapidly adopting it.  Advisors who sell annuities should familiarize themselves with the new requirements to remain complianthttps://dmi.com/blog/your-four-obligations-under-naics-best-interest-model-regulation/#:~:text=Commissioners%20content,adopted%20by%20states%20very%20quickly.
