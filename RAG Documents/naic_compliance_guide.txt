STATE AUDIT REQUIREMENTS
The NAIC has prepared this publication to assist insurers, certified public accountants, and other interested parties
in complying with various state filing requirements for annual audited financial reports. These filing requirements
generally provide for, among other things, specific information concerning the filing and content of audited
financial reports and other related letters and reports with the state insurance department. All of the guidelines in
this area have recently been significantly changed and this publication has been created to summarize these new
requirements.
On June 11, 2006, the NAIC membership voted to approve amendments to the Annual Financial Reporting Model
Regulation (#205), commonly known as the Model Audit Rule. The purpose of this regulation is to improve a
state’s surveillance of the financial condition of insurers by requiring an independent annual audit of the financial
statements by Certified Public Accountants. Significant elements of this regulation are required as an
accreditation standard and have been since the creation of the standards. The amendments adopted in 2006 were
the result of nearly three years of continued research and discussion by financial regulators, members of industry,
public accountants and representatives from trade associations. The revisions deal with primarily three areas:
auditor independence, corporate governance and internal control over financial reporting. In 2014, the NAIC
membership continued to refine effective financial surveillance and voted to approve a new provision relating to
the establishment and maintenance of on internal audit function.
The critical new requirements associated with the 2006 and 2014 revisions have now been adopted by virtually
all member states. Citations for each state’s statute or regulation containing the relevant provisions have been
provided within the publication. The publication summarizes requirements placed on insurers and their external
auditors by the Model Audit Rule and compares and contrasts the requirements included within the NAIC Model
to those ultimately adopted by each NAIC member state.
The summaries contained herein are not intended to be all-inclusive and should not be relied on solely in
determining state-specific requirements. Where a question exists with respect to any requirement, the state’s
statute or regulation should be reviewed and, where necessary, the state insurance department should be contacted.
Every effort has been made to ensure the contents of this publication are complete and factually correct, but the
NAIC makes no warranty as to the completeness or correctness of the information provided. All responsibility
for compliance with individual state insurance codes rests solely with the insurance company and its independent
auditor.

U.S. standard-setting and regulatory support organization created
and governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 states,
the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. Through the NAIC,
state insurance regulators establish standards and best practices,
conduct peer review, and coordinate their regulatory oversight.

views of state regulators domestically and internationally. NAIC
members, together with the central resources of the NAIC, form
the national system of state-based insurance regulation in the U.S.
