Life‑Expectancy and Mortality Data Sources
=========================================

Accurate mortality and life‑expectancy data are essential for pricing life‑insurance policies and performing financial planning calculations.  Several publicly available datasets provide insights into U.S. mortality trends and life‑expectancy distributions.

Social Security Administration (SSA) Period Life Table
----------------------------------------------------

The SSA publishes **period life tables** based on recent mortality experience.  The **2022 period life table**, used in the 2025 Trustees Report, lists death probabilities, number of lives and remaining life expectancy for males and females at each exact agehttps://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html#:~:text=a%20relatively%20short%20period%20of,his%20or%20her%20remaining%20life.  For example:

- At age **0**, the death probability is about **0.006064** for males and **0.005119** for females, with life expectancies of **74.74** and **80.18** years respectivelyhttps://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html#:~:text=Period%20Life%20Table%2C%202022%2C%20as,in%20the%202025%20Trustees%20Report.
- By age **30**, the male death probability falls to roughly **0.002332**, with a remaining life expectancy of about **46.51** years; the female death probability is **0.000988**, with an expectancy of **51.25** yearshttps://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html#:~:text=20%200,30.

These tables allow actuaries and advisors to estimate the probability of survival and calculate the expected present value of life‑insurance benefits or annuity payments.

CDC/NCHS Mortality and Life‑Expectancy Dataset
-----------------------------------------------

The **National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)** provides a dataset of U.S. mortality trends since **1900**.  This dataset highlights **differences in age‑adjusted death rates and life expectancy by race and sex**, using the 2000 U.S. standard population for age adjustmenthttps://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-death-rates-and-life-expectancy-at-birth#:~:text=This%20dataset%20of%20U,birth%20by%20race%20and%20sex.  Key features include:

- **Historical coverage:** Data extend back to 1900, with life‑expectancy figures available up to 2017https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-death-rates-and-life-expectancy-at-birth#:~:text=This%20dataset%20of%20U,birth%20by%20race%20and%20sex.
- **Demographic breakdowns:** Death rates and life expectancies are provided separately for different races and sexes.  The dataset notes that consistent data for the Black population are only available from 1968 onwardhttps://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-death-rates-and-life-expectancy-at-birth#:~:text=Life%20expectancy%20data%20are%20available,death%20rates%20is%20available%20at.
- **Sources:** The dataset aggregates mortality data from historical vital‑statistics reports and the CDC’s WONDER databasehttps://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-death-rates-and-life-expectancy-at-birth#:~:text=SOURCES.

State‑Level Life Expectancy
---------------------------

The **U.S. State Life Expectancy by Sex, 2021** dataset supplies **life expectancy at birth estimates** for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.  It provides separate figures for the **total, male and female populations** in 2021https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-state-life-expectancy-by-sex-2021#:~:text=Metadata%20Updated%3A%20April%2023%2C%202025.  Such state‑level data are useful for advisors who want to tailor insurance recommendations based on regional longevity differences.

Applications in Financial Planning
---------------------------------

These datasets support a variety of insurance and retirement‑planning tasks:

- **Needs analysis:** By combining life‑expectancy data with income replacement goals, advisors can estimate how long survivors will rely on insurance benefits and calibrate coverage amounts.
- **Pricing and underwriting:** Insurers use mortality tables to calculate premiums and reserves.  Understanding demographic mortality trends helps advisors explain why premium rates differ by age, sex and health status.
- **Longevity risk modeling:** State‑level life‑expectancy variations may influence retirement income projections and annuity selection.

Incorporating credible mortality data into planning enhances the accuracy of life‑insurance needs analyses and demonstrates evidence‑based advice.
