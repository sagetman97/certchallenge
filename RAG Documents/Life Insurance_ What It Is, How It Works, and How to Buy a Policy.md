Definition

Life insurance is a contract between an insurer and the policy owner that guarantees a sum of money to the policy’s named beneficiaries when the insured dies.

## What Is Life Insurance?

Life insurance acts as a financial safety net for your family. If you die while it’s active, your insurance company pays a sum of money to the people you’ve named in your policy. This money, known as the death benefit, can help your beneficiaries replace your lost income and cover expenses like housing, food, and utility bills. Life insurance can be used to pay for funeral expenses, cover outstanding debts, or leave a legacy for loved ones or charitable organizations.

## How Life Insurance Works

Life insurance can seem complicated, but understanding how it works, who’s involved, and everyone’s responsibilities can help you make informed decisions about your coverage, whether you’re new to life insurance or looking to switch policies or insurers.

### Policyholder and Beneficiary

The **policyholder** is the person who owns the life insurance policy and is responsible for paying the premiums. The policy usually insures the policyholder, but you can also purchase and manage a policy on behalf of someone else. For example, a business owner might buy a policy on behalf of a high-performing employee, making the company both policyholder and recipient of the death benefit. Similarly, you can take out a policy for a loved one, like a spouse, while acting as the designated policy owner. 

### Fast Fact

You can’t buy life insurance for whoever you want. Insurance companies require you to have an [insurable interest](), meaning you’d face financial hardship if that person died.

The [**beneficiary**]() is the designated person or entity that will receive the death benefit. A life insurance policy can have multiple beneficiaries, such as family members, friends, or even organizations like charities.

### Premiums

Premiums are the [regular payments]() you make to your insurance company to keep the policy active. They are based on factors like age, health, lifestyle, and the amount of coverage you need. For example, a 30-year-old in good health should have significantly lower premiums than a 50-year-old smoker with a history of health issues. The type of policy also matters: Temporary term insurance costs much less than permanent insurance. 

### Death Benefit

The [death benefit]() is the money your loved ones receive when you die. When submitting a life insurance claim, they can usually choose how they want to receive the money:

*   **Lump sum:** They get the entire amount in a single payment. 
*   **Specific income provision:** They can receive the money over time according to a predetermined schedule.
*   **Lifetime income:** Beneficiaries receive guaranteed monthly payments for the rest of their lives. The amount of each payment depends on the total benefit amount as well as the gender and age of the beneficiary at the time of your death.
*   **Interest income option:** The insurance company holds onto the money and only pays the interest earned on it to the beneficiary. When the first beneficiary dies, the original death benefit goes to a secondary beneficiary.1

The death benefit can be used for any purpose, such as paying off a mortgage, covering funeral expenses, or funding a child’s education. It’s also generally [tax-free](), making it a highly valuable and hassle-free financial resource for beneficiaries.2

### Claims Process

To receive the death benefit, your beneficiaries need to file a claim with the insurance company. To initiate the process, they’ll need copies of the death certificate (including a certified copy from the funeral director), the insurance policy, and any other required forms. The insurer will then review the claim. If everything checks out, the company will pay the death benefit to your beneficiaries, usually [within 30 days]() of when the claim was first submitted.3

## Types of Life Insurance

There are two main types of life insurance: [term life insurance](), which provides coverage for a specific period, and permanent life insurance, which covers you for your entire life and often comes with a savings or investment component.

### Term Life Insurance

Term life insurance covers you for a specific period—such as 10, 20, or 30 years. Once the period is over, you stop paying premiums and your policy expires. Because of this time limit, term life insurance is generally [the most affordable option](), making it ideal for anyone looking for low-cost coverage for a specific timeframe. 

For example, if you’re planning a family, you might consider a 20- or 30-year term policy to ensure your children are supported financially, at least through college graduation. Your premiums stay the same during the entire term. However, the longer the term you pick, the more expensive the initial premiums because you lock in the cost for more time.

### Permanent Life Insurance

With [permanent life insurance](), such as whole life or universal life, you pay policy premiums your entire life rather than a set number of years, providing you and your family with lifelong financial protection (or for as long as you pay premiums). Similar to term life, permanent life policies also pay out a death benefit to your beneficiaries. Permanent life insurance also usually comes with a [cash value]() component that can earn interest and grow over time as you continue paying premiums. 

A policy’s cash value component can increase your loved one’s benefit amount and, in some cases, can pay you a dividend—financial compensation based on the insurance company’s financial performance. You can also withdraw money from the cash value or take out a loan using it as collateral. 

### Warning

Any money you withdraw or borrow from your cash value reduces the amount your beneficiaries receive when you die. If you withdraw too much or fail to repay a loan, your policy could lapse, which would end your coverage.4

Here are some common types of permanent life insurance:

*   **Whole life insurance:** The most popular type of permanent life insurance offered by insurance companies, [whole life policies]() feature a cash value component that grows at a fixed interest rate set by the insurer.5
*   **Universal life insurance (UL):** This is a type of permanent life insurance includes an interest-earning cash value. Unlike term and regular whole life policies, you may be able to adjust your [UL policy]() premiums over time, potentially accepting less coverage in exchange for lower payments, making it appealing if you want coverage flexibility.
*   **Variable life insurance:** A permanent policy that lets you invest your cash value, usually in mutual funds.
*   **Variable universal life insurance (VUL):** A [VUL policy]() combines the flexible premiums of universal life insurance with the investment options of [variable life insurance](). You can invest your cash value in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other market-based assets. These investments can potentially earn immense returns. But market downturns can decrease the cash value and potentially the death benefit. Your premiums can increase or decrease depending on the performance of your investments.6
*   **Final expense insurance:** This is a type of whole life insurance with a small death benefit, usually between $2,000 and $50,000. It’s designed to cover funeral and burial costs, as well as other end-of-life expenses.7

## Common Life Insurance Riders

[Life insurance riders]() are optional add-ons that can enhance your policy’s coverage. Here are some common riders:

*   **Accelerated death benefit rider:** This allows you to access a portion of your death benefit if you’re diagnosed with a terminal illness.
*   **Waiver of premium rider:** This waives your premium payments if you become disabled and can’t work.
*   **Accidental death benefit rider:** This pays out an additional death benefit if you die in an accident.
*   **Child term rider:** This provides a small death benefit for your children.
*   **Long-term care rider:** This allows you to use your death benefit to pay for long-term care expenses.

## How to Buy Life Insurance

Buying life insurance involves several steps, from determining your needs to comparing quotes and applying for a policy.

1.  **Determine your needs:** The first step is to figure out how much life insurance you need. This will depend on your financial situation, including your income, debts, and dependents. A common rule of thumb is to have a death benefit that’s 10 to 12 times your annual income.8
2.  **Choose a policy type:** Once you know how much coverage you need, you can decide which type of policy is right for you. Term life insurance is a good option if you’re looking for affordable coverage for a specific period. Permanent life insurance is a better choice if you want lifelong coverage with a cash value component.
3.  **Compare quotes:** It’s a good idea to get quotes from several different insurance companies to find the best rates. You can use an online comparison tool or work with an independent insurance agent to get quotes.
4.  **Apply for a policy:** Once you’ve chosen a policy, you’ll need to fill out an application. You’ll be asked to provide information about your health, lifestyle, and medical history. You may also need to take a medical exam.
5.  **Review and sign the policy:** Once your application is approved, you’ll receive a policy to review and sign. Make sure you understand all the terms and conditions before you sign.

## Benefits of Life Insurance

Life insurance offers several benefits, including:

*   **Financial security for your loved ones:** The death benefit can help your beneficiaries replace your lost income and cover expenses.
*   **Peace of mind:** Knowing that your loved ones will be taken care of financially can give you peace of mind.
*   **Tax-free death benefit:** The death benefit is generally tax-free, which means your beneficiaries will receive the full amount.

*   **Estate planning:** Life insurance can be used to pay estate taxes and other expenses, ensuring that your assets are passed on to your heirs.

*   **Married couples:** If you and your spouse rely on each other’s income, life insurance can help the surviving spouse cover expenses.
