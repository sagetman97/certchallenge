## How does life insurance work?

With term and permanent life insurance, you make premium payments so that in the event of your passing, your loved ones and beneficiaries will receive the death benefit proceeds from the policy, income tax free. Term insurance is for a certain period of time, while permanent is for life as long as the premiums are paid.

## Who should consider life insurance?

If you have anyone that depends on you financially or if you don't want to leave your loved ones with burial costs or debt, then you should consider life insurance. And if you're just starting out and want to lock in an affordable rate for when you have a family, different types of life insurance can help with that, too.

## Life insurance types

Term Life Insurance

### Term Life Insurance

Term life provides you affordable, convenient coverage for a certain amount of time — the term during which you pay your premiums — and it is often convertible to a permanent policy. Talk to a [financial professional]() for a personalized insurance needs analysis.

Permanent Life Insurance

### Participating Whole Life Insurance

With whole life insurance, you’re guaranteed a death benefit, and you’re able to build cash value over time. Your cash value grows tax deferred so it’s there when you need it. In addition, you have the opportunity to earn dividends2, which are not guaranteed.

### Universal Life Insurance

Much like whole life, universal life insurance has the potential to build cash value with the additional benefit of flexible premiums. This means if you ever need to lower the cost of your premiums for a specific time period, you may be able to.

### Variable Universal Life Insurance

If you’re interested in controlling how your premiums are invested, then variable universal life insurance may be an option for you. Like universal life, variable universal life insurance has flexible premiums and the potential to build account value with the added bonus of investment options.
