Term vs. Whole Life Insurance
===========================

**Term life insurance**

- Term life insurance is simpler and cheaper than whole life and is ideal when you mainly need income replacement for a specific period, such as while raising children or paying off a mortgage.  Term policies do not accumulate cash valuehttps://www.investopedia.com/term-life-vs-whole-life-5075430#:~:text=Term%20life%20insurance%20is%20simpler,and%20best%20uses%20of%20each.
- Term life provides coverage for a predetermined period – often 10, 20 or 30 years.  The longer the term, the higher the premium.  If the insured dies during the term, beneficiaries receive a tax‑free death benefit; if the policyholder outlives the term, the policy expires with no payouthttps://www.investopedia.com/term-life-vs-whole-life-5075430#:~:text=Term%20Life%20Insurance%3A%20Affordable%20Coverage,for%20a%20Limited%20Time.
- **Benefits**: premiums are affordable; coverage is straightforward; you can select a term length that corresponds to debt obligations; and the money saved on premiums can be invested in other vehicleshttps://www.investopedia.com/term-life-vs-whole-life-5075430#:~:text=Benefits%20of%20Term%20Life%20Insurance.
- **Drawbacks**: term policies have no cash value; coverage ends when the term expires; and renewal costs can increase sharply with agehttps://www.investopedia.com/term-life-vs-whole-life-5075430#:~:text=Drawbacks%20of%20Term%20Life%20Insurance.
- **Who should consider term life**: young families needing income replacement during child‑rearing years, homeowners wanting to insure against mortgage debt, or individuals with significant debtshttps://www.investopedia.com/term-life-vs-whole-life-5075430#:~:text=Who%20Should%20Consider%20Term%20Life,Insurance.

**Whole life insurance**

- Whole life insurance provides lifelong coverage as long as premiums are paid and includes a cash‑value component that grows at a guaranteed rate.  Because it can act like a tax‑advantaged retirement savings plan, whole life policies are significantly more expensive than term lifehttps://www.investopedia.com/term-life-vs-whole-life-5075430#:~:text=Term%20life%20insurance%20is%20simpler,and%20best%20uses%20of%20each.
- **Benefits**: protection does not expire; cash value accumulates tax‑deferred and may pay dividends; premiums are fixed for life; and policyholders can borrow against or withdraw cash valuehttps://www.investopedia.com/term-life-vs-whole-life-5075430#:~:text=Benefits%20of%20Whole%20Life%20Insurance.
- **Drawbacks**: premiums are much higher than term life; the policy is more complex; and borrowing or withdrawing from cash value reduces the death benefit and could cause the policy to lapsehttps://www.investopedia.com/term-life-vs-whole-life-5075430#:~:text=Whole%20life%20insurance%20is%20a,access%20while%20you%E2%80%99re%20still%20alivehttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp#:~:text=Any%20money%20you%20withdraw%20or,4.

**Comparing term and whole life**

- Term life is cost‑effective for temporary needs and frees cash for other investments.  Whole life is suitable when lifelong coverage and cash accumulation are desiredhttps://www.investopedia.com/term-life-vs-whole-life-5075430#:~:text=Term%20life%20insurance%20is%20simpler,and%20best%20uses%20of%20each.
- Some term policies offer a conversion option that allows the policyholder to switch to whole life without a medical exam if they later decide they need lifetime coveragehttps://www.investopedia.com/term-life-vs-whole-life-5075430#:~:text=,life%20policy%20for%20right%20now.
