# **AIE7 Certification Challenge - Project Answers**

## **Task 1: Defining your Problem and Audience**

### **Deliverable 1: Succinct Problem Description**

Financial advisors lack sufficient understanding of life insurance products, coverage calculations, and product selection criteria to confidently recommend life insurance as part of a diversified portfolio, causing them to avoid this integral component of risk management entirely.

### **Deliverable 2: Problem for Specific User**

**Target User**: Financial Advisors and Investment Professionals

Financial advisors face a fundamental knowledge gap when it comes to life insurance that prevents them from providing comprehensive financial planning services. Despite life insurance being an integral part of a diversified, risk-averse portfolio with safety nets, advisors often lack the deep understanding needed to confidently explain how life insurance works, determine appropriate coverage amounts, select the right product types for different client situations, and articulate the strategic benefits within a broader financial plan. This knowledge deficit creates significant barriers: advisors feel uncomfortable making life insurance recommendations, so they simply avoid the topic entirely, leaving clients without crucial protection and missing opportunities to provide truly comprehensive financial planning services.

This creates several critical problems: clients miss out on essential risk management tools that could protect their families and provide tax advantages, advisors lose potential revenue from life insurance commissions and comprehensive planning fees, and the overall financial planning relationship suffers from incomplete advice. Most concerning, this avoidance means clients may not have adequate protection in place, leaving families vulnerable to financial hardship in the event of premature death, while advisors miss opportunities to demonstrate their full value as comprehensive financial planners.

## **Task 6: The Benefits of Advanced Retrieval**

### **Deliverable 1: Advanced Retrieval Techniques Selection**

Based on my analysis of the financial advisory domain and the limitations identified in my Naive Basic Retriever evaluation, I selected four advanced retrieval techniques to implement and assess:

1. **Multi-Query Retriever**: This technique generates multiple query variations from a single user input to improve recall by addressing different aspects of complex financial queries, which could benefit comprehensive life insurance advice that often requires information from multiple perspectives (product features, calculations, regulations, and client scenarios).

2. **Ensemble Retriever**: This approach combines multiple retrieval strategies using rank-fusion to leverage the strengths of different retrieval methods, which could be particularly valuable for financial advisory queries that may benefit from both semantic similarity and keyword matching to capture both conceptual understanding and specific product terminology.

3. **Parent Document Retriever**: This technique retrieves smaller "child chunks" but returns larger "parent documents" for context, which could be ideal for financial documents where complete regulatory statements, calculation methodologies, and product descriptions need to be preserved in their full context for accurate advice.

4. **BM25 Retriever**: This keyword-based retrieval algorithm provides a baseline comparison to semantic approaches, which could be important for understanding whether financial domain queries benefit more from semantic understanding or traditional keyword matching, especially for specific product names, regulatory terms, and calculation formulas.

### **Deliverable 2: Advanced Retrieval Implementation**

**Implementation Strategy**: I developed a modular evaluation framework that allows me to test each advanced retrieval technique independently while reusing expensive shared resources (document loading, dataset generation, and base vector store creation). This approach could ensure efficient testing and prevent redundant API calls and computation.

**Multi-Query Retriever Implementation**: 
- Uses `MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm()` to generate multiple query variations
- Leverages GPT-4 to create diverse query perspectives from single user input
- Could improve recall by addressing different aspects of complex financial queries

**Ensemble Retriever Implementation**:
- Combines vector similarity search with BM25 keyword retrieval
- Uses equal weighting for rank-fusion across multiple retrieval strategies
- Could balance semantic understanding with keyword precision

**Parent Document Retriever Implementation**:
- Implements parent-child document splitting with different chunk sizes
- Uses `InMemoryStore` for parent document storage
- Could preserve complete context for regulatory and calculation content

**BM25 Retriever Implementation**:
- Uses `rank_bm25` library for keyword-based retrieval
- Provides baseline comparison to semantic approaches
- Tests effectiveness of keyword matching for financial terminology

**Evaluation Framework**: Each retriever is implemented as a standalone script that loads shared state (documents, dataset, vector store) and runs comprehensive RAGAS evaluation with the four core metrics: Faithfulness, Response Relevancy, Context Precision, and Context Recall.

4. **Cost-Performance Trade-offs**: While Multi-Query achieved the best performance, it also had the highest latency (12.34s) and cost ($0.72 total). The Ensemble retriever provided a good balance of performance (0.8655) and reasonable cost ($0.20 total).

### **Deliverable 2: Future Application Improvements**

**Second Half Course Improvements**: Based on my performance analysis and identified limitations, I plan to implement several key improvements to enhance the application's effectiveness for financial advisory use cases.

**1. Fine-tuned Embedding Model Implementation**:
- I will implement a fine-tuned embedding model specifically trained on financial and insurance terminology to improve semantic understanding of domain-specific queries
- This could potentially improve answer relevancy scores by 15-20% and context recall by 10-15% based on similar implementations in financial domains

**2. Hybrid Retrieval Strategy Optimization**:
- I will develop a dynamic retrieval strategy that automatically selects the optimal retriever based on query complexity and type
- Simple queries could use the cost-effective Naive Basic Retriever, while complex financial planning queries could automatically trigger the Multi-Query or Ensemble approaches

**3. Portfolio Analysis Agent Implementation**:
- I will create a specialized portfolio analysis agent that supports uploading customer/prospect financial documents and provides detailed breakdowns of how life insurance could fit into that portfolio including what type, how much, and why
- This could enable personalized, data-driven life insurance recommendations based on actual client financial situations

**4. Context-Aware Response Generation**:
- I will develop a response generation system that considers the retrieved context quality and adjusts response style accordingly
- High-confidence retrievals could receive detailed responses, while lower-confidence retrievals could receive more conservative, fact-checking responses

**5. Real-time Performance Monitoring**:
- I will implement comprehensive monitoring using LangSmith to track performance metrics in production
- This will enable continuous optimization based on real user interaction patterns and feedback

**6. Advanced Chunking Strategies**:
- I will experiment with semantic chunking techniques that preserve complete financial concepts and regulatory statements
- This could improve context precision and recall for complex financial documents

**7. RAG Database Enhancement**:
- I will improve the RAG database to include additional documentation for increased answer quality, such as textbooks, more articles, more detailed product specifications for specific companies, and comprehensive regulatory guides
- This could significantly improve context recall and answer relevancy by providing more comprehensive and detailed source material

**Expected Performance Improvements**: These enhancements could potentially improve the overall average score from 0.8768 (Multi-Query) to 0.90+ while maintaining cost-effectiveness and reducing latency through optimized retrieval strategies.
